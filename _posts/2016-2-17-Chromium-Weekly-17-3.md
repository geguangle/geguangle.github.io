[Announcement: Telemetry project has moved to a new repo](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/chromium-dev/Announcement$3A$20Telemetry$20project$20has$20moved$20to$20a$20new$20repo/chromium-dev/b79F7uB5-_c/eNijQAXbBQAJ)

----------
     Telemetry has been moved into the catapult repo, and can now be found in the chromium
     checkout at src/third_party/catapult/telemetry.

原来位于tools/telemetry，后面将移动到src/third_party/catapult/，并使用单独的repo(catapult)。
